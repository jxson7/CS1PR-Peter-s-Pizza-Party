# CS1PR: Peter's Pizza Party

The provided program employs an SDL2 lirbary to illustrate graphical components, coded in C and C++. This program has been developed and created by Parallel Realities
titled "Pete's Pizza Party 6". The aims of this project were to develop an extension to the existing piece and further elaborate the changes that were made.
As part of this project, a skeleton code was provided to support my development, authorised by the University of Reading.

I would like to thank Dr Julian Krunkel for his support during this project.
